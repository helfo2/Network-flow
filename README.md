# TP1-AEDS3-Network flow

It's a simple application for traversing a graph using the concept for Ford-Fulkerson's algorithm, which uses BFS (Breadth-first search) 
idea to compute the max flow in a weighted directed graph making usage of an auxiliary queue.

All code is written in C and it's organized with headers for function declarations and .c files for functions implementations. 
The actual problem is solved in the tp1.c file as well as there're some tests in the tp1.in file.

Documentation is presented in Doc.pdf file in Portuguese.

It was compiled using gcc 5.4.0 version and memory tested with Valgrind 3.11.0
